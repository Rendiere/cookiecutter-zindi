# Cookiecutter for Zindi Competitions

This is a template cookiecutter project for bootstrapping your work on Zindi competitions (or any platform for that matter). It contains :

- a directory structure for sorting your notebooks, data, models, figures, tasks and source code to reuse in notebooks
- a conda environment file with the basic python libraries and some extras :
  - numpy / pandas / scikit-learn / seaborn / statsmodels / plotly / jupyterlab classic Data Science stack
  - [xgoost](https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), [catboost](https://catboost.ai/docs/), [lightgbm](https://lightgbm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and [keras](https://keras.io/) for prediction
  - [category_encoders](https://contrib.scikit-learn.org/categorical-encoding/) and [missingno](https://github.com/ResidentMario/missingno) for data processing. 
  - [eli5](https://eli5.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for model interpretation.
  - [mlxtend](http://rasbt.github.io/mlxtend/) because it's probably going to be useful.
  - [pandas-profiling](https://github.com/pandas-profiling/pandas-profiling) for generating HTML reports on pandas dataframes
  - [invoke](http://docs.pyinvoke.org/) as a replacement to `Makefile` for managing project tasks
  - [path.py](https://pathpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) for browsing files in Python

## Prerequisites

- [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) >=5.x
- [Cookiecutter](https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter) >= 1.4.0: This can be installed with pip by or conda depending on how you manage your Python packages:

```bash
$ pip install cookiecutter
```

or

```bash
$ conda config --add channels conda-forge
$ conda install cookiecutter
```

## Generate a new project

In a folder where you want your project generated :
`cookiecutter https://github.com/rendiere/cookiecutter-zindi.git`

You can also clone the project in `<path/to/template>`,
and from the folder where you want to generate your project, launch `cookiecutter <path/to/template>`

It will ask for the following values :

```
full_name
email
project_name
project_short_description
version
```

Complete the values for your project and voil√† ! Then follow the `README` inside your new project for further installation.
